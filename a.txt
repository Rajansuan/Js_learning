What is git?
Free source Version Control System

What is version control system?
- A system that keeps track of our files or projects
- It allows you to revert selected files to a previous state, comapre the changes, checks who made the changes
- It helps when multiple peoples are working on the same code

2 types of VCS
a. Centralized Version Control
b. Distributed Version Control

In distributed version control people have a project on thier pc's with a history, a complete copy, keep pushing into the local repo and then network needed when pushing
Ex - git

What is Git?
Github is a web based hosting service for git repositories.
Note - You can use Git without Github, but you cannot use the Github without Git.

Git is nothing but a local repository to main different versions of your project
Github is public web hosting service and is used for hosting git repossitories

Local repository - Working copy private workplace

Working Directory and Staging Area or Index - An intermediate area where commits can be formatted and reviewed before completing the commits

Push - Send a change to another repository
Pull - Grab a change from a repository

Basic Workflow of Git - 

Step 1 - You modify a file from the working Directory
Step 2 - You add these files to the staging area
Step 3 - You perform commit operation that moves the files from the staging area. After push operation, it stores the changes permanently to the Git repository

Repository is a central storage location for managing and tracking changes in files and directories

Concepts of Git - 
1. Blob - Blob stands for Binary Large Object. Each version of a file is represented by blob. A blob holds the file data but does not contain any metadata about the file. It is a binary file and in Git database, it is named as SHA1 hash of that file. In Git, files are not addressed by names, everything is content addressed.

2. Trees - Tree is an object, which represents a directory, it holds blobs as well as other sub diretories. A tree is a binary file that stores references to blobs and trees which are also named as SHA1 hash of that object. Basically trees are used for associations 
(Hashing is the process of transforming any given key or a string of characters into another value)

 In Git, every commit you make is assigned a unique SHA-1 hash (Secure Hash Algorithm 1) value. This hash value is like a fingerprint for each commit. It helps Git keep track of every change made in the repository. Remember, hash values in Git are crucial for maintaining the integrity of your projects.

<Commits>
- Commits holds the current status of the repo. A commit is also named by SHA1 hash.
- Every commit object has a pointer to the parent commit object (think it has a linked list)

Git commands - 
1. Clone - Bring a repo hosted somewhere like github into a folder or your local machine
2. Add - Track your files and changes it Git, basically adds them to the staging area
3. Commit - Save your files in git
4. Push - Upload your commits to a git repo
5. Pull - Download changes from a remote repo to your local repo

What do different colors represent in github commit history
1. Green - Represents whats new have been added to the file
2. Red - Represents what have been removed from the file

Steps to initialise the git on your system
1. Install the git software
2. In terminal of your working directory write - git init
3. Checks for git status
4. then add the files to staging area - git add ,
5. Commit the files to the local repo - git commit -m "local commit"
Now these files are in the local repo, these are not yet present in our github repo
Now, check if the remote github repo is initialised or not - git remote -v
So, now we will add the remote repo to our local repo - git remote add origin pasteTheLink.git
6. Now add the remote repo - git remote add origin https://github.com/Rajansuan/Js_learning.git
7. git push origin master
